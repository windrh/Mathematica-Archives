# Mathematica 
This is an archive of a small part of the Mathematica that I used in my calculus class, since I no longer need to use it on my computer. Free cloud service > local storage.  Storing it here incase I ever need to come back and simulate some sort of calculus operations in a similar fashion to what is in these files.
